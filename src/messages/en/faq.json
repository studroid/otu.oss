            "question": "What is OTU?",
            "answer": "OTU is an AI-powered note-taking app created by OpenTutorials. It helps you easily create notes while AI connects related content and sends you reminders."

        {
            "question": "Can I use it without signing up?",
            "answer": "Yes, you can start immediately as an anonymous user. However, in anonymous mode, your data is only stored on your device and cannot be accessed from other devices. Logging in saves your data securely to the server and allows access from all your devices."
        },
        {
            "question": "How is my data synchronized?",
            "answer": "Logged-in users' data is automatically synchronized with the server. You can access the same notes from web, iOS, and Android apps."
        },
        {
            "question": "Can I use it offline?",
            "answer": "Yes, pages you've accessed once can be viewed offline. Content created offline will automatically sync when you reconnect."
        },
        {
            "question": "What AI features are available?",
            "answer": "We offer AI chat (answers based on your notes), automatic title generation, AI writing assistance (sentence completion, summarization, tone adjustment, etc.), and image OCR (text extraction)."
        },
        {
            "question": "Are there limits on AI feature usage?",
            "answer": "AI, OCR, and image upload features have monthly usage limits. When exceeded, these features are temporarily restricted until the next month's reset, but text note features remain available."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do I use the reminder feature?",

            "question": "Can I share my notes with others?",
            "answer": "When you 'publish' a note, a public link is generated for sharing. Unpublishing deactivates the link."
